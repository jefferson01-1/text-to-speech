Text to Speech Application
This is a simple Text to Speech (TTS) application built with Python and the gTTS library. It allows you to input text and select a language, and then generates an audio file with the spoken version of the text.

To use the application, you need to have Python 3 installed and the gTTS library. You can install the gTTS library using the following command:

pip install gTTS

To run the application, simply run the text_to_speech.py file in your preferred Python environment. The application will open a GUI window where you can input your text and select the language.

If you encounter any errors or issues, please ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies and have an internet connection.

Thank you for using the Text to Speech Application!
